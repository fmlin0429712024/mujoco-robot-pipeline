# From Demo to Production

> **The final bridge:** What it takes to scale from working prototype to operational fleet

**Reading time:** 8 minutes

## The Production Gap

You've built a working demo in simulation. Now what?

**Demo reality:**
- Runs on your laptop
- Controlled environment
- No safety requirements
- You're the only user

**Production reality:**
- Runs on 2,000 robots in nursing homes
- Diverse, unpredictable environments
- Safety-critical (people nearby!)
- 24/7 operations, non-technical users

**This document:** High-level overview of the engineering bridge between these two worlds

## The Four Pillars of Production

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         Production-Grade System              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
          │
          ├─▶ 1. Edge Deployment
          │    └─ Where code runs on robot
          │
          ├─▶ 2. Fleet Operations  
          │    └─ Deploy & manage at scale
          │
          ├─▶ 3. Safety Engineering
          │    └─ Prevent harm & damage
          │
          └─▶ 4. Calibration
               └─ Align sim to real world
```

## Pillar 1: Edge Deployment

### **The Question: Where Does Your ACT Policy Run?**

**In simulation:** Your laptop (M2 MacBook)

**In production:** On-robot computer (edge device)

### **Common Choices**

| Device | Use Case | Cost | Power |
|--------|----------|------|-------|
| **Jetson Orin** | Vision-heavy (camera processing) | $500-1K | GPU |
| **Intel NUC** | Classical nav + simple vision | $300-500 | CPU |
| **Raspberry Pi** | Simple tasks only | $50 | Very low |

**For your AMR:** Jetson Orin (YOLO vision detection needs GPU)

**For your pick-place:** Could run on NUC (ACT inference not too heavy)

---

### **What Runs Where?**

```
Your AMR System:

Edge (On-Robot):
├─ YOLO vision detection (real-time)
├─ SLAM localization (real-time)
├─ A* path planning (real-time)
├─ Motor control (real-time)
└─ Safety monitors (real-time)

Cloud (Server):
├─ Fleet dashboard
├─ Data collection for retraining
├─ Model updates distribution
└─ Analytics & monitoring
```

**Design principle:** Real-time decisions on edge, learning and coordination in cloud

---

## Pillar 2: Fleet Operations

### **The Challenge: Deploy Models to 2,000 Robots**

**Your current workflow (demo):**
```bash
# Manual process
python train_policy.py  # On laptop
scp model.pt robot:/models/  # Copy to ONE robot
```

**Production fleet workflow:**
```
1. Train new model (Isaac Sim data)
2. Validate in staging (10 robots)
3. Canary rollout (50 robots, monitor 24h)
4. Full deployment (2,000 robots)
5. Monitor performance, rollback if needed
```

---

### **Key Technologies (High-Level)**

**Docker:** Package your ACT policy + dependencies
```
Your model + Python + LeRobot → Docker container
Deploy same container to all 2,000 robots ✅
```

**CI/CD Pipeline:** Automate testing & deployment
```
Code change → Auto-test → Auto-deploy (if tests pass)
```

**Data Flywheel:** Continuous improvement
```
Robots collect new data → Retrain model → Deploy update
(This is how Tesla Autopilot keeps improving!)
```

---

### **Fleet Dashboard**

**What you monitor:**
- Success rates per robot
- Failure modes (which tasks failing?)
- Battery levels, uptime
- Software versions across fleet

**Why it matters:** Spot problems before they scale

---

## Pillar 3: Safety Engineering

### **Critical Insight: Don't Use Learning for Safety!**

**Bad approach:** ❌
```
Train RL policy to avoid collisions
→ Unpredictable, can fail in novel situations
```

**Good approach:** ✅
```
Classical safety layers (deterministic, proven):
├─ Emergency stop (hardware button)
├─ Collision detection (force sensors + lidar)
├─ Geofencing (virtual boundaries)
└─ Behavior limits (max speed, acceleration)
```

**Your AMR example:**
- ACT policy controls navigation (learned)
- Safety monitors run in parallel (classical)
- Safety can override policy any time

---

### **Safety Architecture**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│        Learned Policy (ACT)         │
│  "Navigate to Room 302"             │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
             ↓ commands
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│      Safety Layer (Classical)        │
│  - Check: Too close to person? STOP │
│  - Check: Outside boundary? STOP    │
│  - Check: Speed too high? LIMIT     │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
             ↓ safe commands
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│         Motor Controllers            │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Lesson:** Learning is powerful, but safety is too critical to leave to learned models

---

### **Common Safety Features**

| Feature | Purpose | Implementation |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| **E-stop** | Human override | Hardware button |
| **Collision detection** | Prevent crashes | Lidar + bumper sensors |
| **Geofencing** | Stay in allowed areas | GPS/SLAM boundaries |
| **Speed limits** | Controlled motion | Classical PID limits |
| **Watchdog** | Detect system freeze | Heartbeat monitoring |

---

## Pillar 4: Calibration

### **The Sim-to-Real Gap**

**Problem:** Your ACT policy learned perfect camera poses in simulation

**Reality:** Real robot camera is slightly off:
- Mounting angle not exactly as modeled
- Lens distortion
- Lighting differences

**Result:** Policy reaches for cube but misses by 5cm ❌

---

### **Hand-Eye Calibration**

**What it solves:** Align camera coordinate frame with robot arm frame

**Process (high-level):**
```
1. Move robot to known positions
2. Take camera images of checkerboard/AprilTag
3. Calculate transformation matrix
4. Apply correction to all camera observations
```

**When you need it:**
- Any vision-based manipulation
- Real robot deployment
- After hardware changes

**Tools:** OpenCV, ViSP, ROS calibration packages

---

### **Other Calibrations**

- **Joint calibration:** Encoder offsets for accurate positioning
- **Force/torque calibration:** Gripper force sensing
- **Multi-robot calibration:** Relative poses for collaboration

**Key insight:** Simulation is perfect, reality needs calibration

---

## Putting It All Together

### **Your AMR Journey: Demo → Production**

**Month 1-4: Demo Phase (Docs 01-05)**
```
✅ Build MuJoCo prototype
✅ Train ACT policy
✅ Prove concepts work
```

**Month 5-8: Pilot Phase (This Doc)**
```
→ Deploy to 10 nursing homes
→ Edge compute setup (Jetson Orin)
→ Safety validation
→ Calibration per site
→ Collect real-world data
```

**Month 9-12: Scale Phase (Doc 03 strategy)**
```
→ Isaac Sim training (domain randomization)
→ Model updates via CI/CD
→ Scale to 100 → 500 → 2,000 facilities
→ Data flywheel for continuous improvement
```

---

## Decision Framework

### **When to Focus on Each Pillar**

**Edge Deployment:**
- Day 1 of real robot testing
- Need: Hardware procurement, setup

**Fleet Operations:**
- When deploying to 10+ robots
- Need: Docker, basic CI/CD

**Safety:**
- Before ANY real deployment
- Need: E-stop, collision detection (non-negotiable!)

**Calibration:**
- First real robot test (immediately!)
- Need: Calibration tools, test protocols

---

## High-Level Best Practices

### **1. Start Small, Scale Gradually**

```
1 robot (lab) → 10 robots (pilot) → 100 robots → 2,000 robots

Don't skip steps! Each reveals different problems.
```

---

### **2. Separate Concerns**

**Good architecture:**
- Learning: Perception, decision-making (ACT, YOLO)
- Classical: Safety, critical control loops
- Cloud: Non-real-time analytics, retraining

**Bad architecture:**
- Everything in one monolithic learned model
- No safety fallbacks
- Real-time analytics in cloud (latency issues!)

---

### **3. Data is Your Asset**

**Demo thinking:** Data is just for training

**Production thinking:** Data flywheel
```
Deploy robots → Collect edge cases → Retrain → Deploy
                      ↑                      ↓
                      ←──────────────────────┘
                        (Continuous cycle)
```

**Your 2,000 AMRs generate:** ~10TB/year of navigation data → fuel for next model generation

---

### **4. Monitor Everything**

**Key metrics to track:**
- Model performance (success rate per robot)
- System health (uptime, errors)
- Safety events (e-stops, collisions)
- Edge cases (when did policy fail?)

**Why:** Catch problems early, prioritize improvements

---

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Why It Fails | Better Approach |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| "My model works in sim, ship it!" | Sim ≠ real world | Pilot phase testing |
| "Let learned policy handle safety" | Unpredictable failures | Classical safety layers |
| "Manual deployment to each robot" | Doesn't scale | CI/CD pipeline |
| "No calibration needed" | Sim poses are idealized | Calibrate every robot |
| "Collect data once, done" | World changes, edge cases appear | Data flywheel |

---

## What This Doc Doesn't Cover

**Intentionally omitted (too implementation-specific):**

❌ RTOS selection details  
❌ Specific CI/CD pipeline code  
❌ Kubernetes for fleet management  
❌ Detailed calibration mathematics  
❌ Network architecture (edge/cloud)

**Why:** These are deep topics deserving dedicated resources. This doc gives you the **conceptual map** to know what to learn next.

## Recommended Next Steps

**If deploying to real robots:**

1. **Read:** "Deploying Machine Learning Models" (ML Engineering)
2. **Learn:** Docker basics (1 day)
3. **Implement:** Safety layer FIRST (before fancy AI!)
4. **Tool:** OpenCV camera calibration tutorials
5. **Study:** ROS 2 for production robotics

**If still in research/learning:**

1. Continue with your MuJoCo demo
2. Understand these production concepts exist
3. Reference this doc when you're ready to scale

## Key Takeaways

1. **Production ≠ scaled-up demo** - Requires different engineering

2. **Edge + Cloud architecture** - Real-time on robot, learning in cloud

3. **Safety = Classical methods** - Never trust only learned models for safety

4. **Calibration is mandatory** - Sim is perfect, reality isn't

5. **Data flywheel = competitive moat** - Continuous improvement via deployed robots

6. **Start small, scale gradually** - 1 → 10 → 100 → 2,000 robots

7. **This is a preview, not a manual** - Know what exists, learn details when deploying
